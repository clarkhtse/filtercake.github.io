## Moneyquote:

> by hard-coding Bootstrap's class names into your HTML, you're marrying your code to Bootstrap. Bootstrap's very name should indicate that developers should consider it a starter library: something to get you out the gate faster, not your permanent design solution.

## TL;DR:

- don't clutter markup with declarative classes
- use provided components as mixins to your (of course) semantic html
- do not depend on external naming conventions
